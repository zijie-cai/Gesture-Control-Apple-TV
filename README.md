# Gesture Control Apple TV 🍎📺

## Overview
This project lets you control your Apple TV with simple hand gestures. Designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, it walks you through the implementation steps using a detailed Jupyter Notebook guide.

## 📽️ Video Demonstration

## 📚 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- mediapipe
- pyatv
- WebCam
- Apple TV

## 🛠 Installation and Setup
- Create and activate a Python virtual environment (venv/conda):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv env 
    source env/bin/activate # Unix/MacOS
    ./env/Scripts/activate # Windows
    ```
    Alternatively: 
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate env
    ```

- Upgrade pip and install required libraries (skip if using conda):
    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

**Note:** The main libraries are 'opencv-python' and 'mediapipe' for hand tracking and 'pyatv' for interacting with Apple TV.

## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run
Simply open the `GestureControlAppleTV.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions there.

## 🚀 Future Updates
Due to the recent tvOS 16 update, I plan on migrating this project to the tvOS platform for seamless integration. This will include utilizing tvOS APIs for more accurate control mappings and potentialy coming up with even better gestures for a more user-friendly experience.
